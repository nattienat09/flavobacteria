### :collision: Box2D simulation of the Viscous/Elastic Coupling Model in head-to-side (flavobacteria) collisions. :collision:
#### Made in Processing 3 using the "Box2D for Processing" library.
Rigid Bodies: flavobacteria are considered rigid bodies so they have no flexibilty
Flexible Bodies: flavobacteria are flexible and can bend
Flexible but not as flexible: custom forces are applied that keep the flavos from being too flexible,one step closer to reality
